# Introduction
D-house is a UCI-compliant chess engine written in Python.

# Run it
D-house only uses the Python standard library, so you only need a working version of Python 3.9 or above. 
However, you may need to install a program such as 
[pyinstaller](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/), or [py2exe](https://pypi.org/project/py2exe/) if you wish to create an executable. 

Currently only tested on Windows but may work on other operating systems.

# Performance
D-house appears to play better single-core rather than multi-core for some reason.

Playing strength is mediocre in fast time controls, but scales up in medium to long time controls (e.g. 40/15 and 40/40).
