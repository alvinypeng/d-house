# Introduction
D-house is a UCI-compliant chess engine written in Python. 

# Run it
D-house only uses the Python standard library, so you only need a working version of Python 3.9 or above. 
However, you may need to install a program such as 
[pyinstaller](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/), [py2exe](https://pypi.org/project/py2exe/) or [NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download)
if you wish to create an executable.

Currently only tested on Windows.

# Performance
Plays best in longer time formats (preferably with increment).
