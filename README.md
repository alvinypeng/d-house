# Introduction
D-house is a UCI-compliant chess engine written in Python.

# UCI configurations

**Hash**

Size of the hash table in megabytes.

**Threads**

Number of threads used in searching. Set this to the number of CPU cores available for best performance.

**OnlineSyzygy**

Allow D-house to probe the online [lichess](https://tablebase.lichess.ovh) 7-man Syzygy tablebase.

# Run it
D-house only uses the Python standard library, so you only need a working version of Python 3.9 or above.
However, you will need to install a program such as 
[pyinstaller](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/), or [py2exe](https://pypi.org/project/py2exe/) if you wish to create an executable. 
```
pyinstaller --onefile main.py --name=d-house
```
Currently only tested on Windows but may work on other operating systems.

Future versions of Python are planned to be up to [5 times faster!](https://github.com/markshannon/faster-cpython/blob/master/plan.md) I expect this engine to improve with subsequent Python releases.
